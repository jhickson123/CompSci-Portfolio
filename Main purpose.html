    <p> 1. What is a motherboard, and what does it do? </p>

    <p> A motherboard is basically the printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted. This motherboard is also known as the "brain" of the computer. If you are looking to build your own desktop, it is very necessary to find a good motherboard.</p>

2. What is a CPU and what does it do?

      <p> CPU (also called a microprocessor) stands for "central processing unit". It's a very suitable name, because it describes exactly what the CPU does: it processes instructions that it gathers from decoding the code in programs and other such files. A CPU has four primary functions: fetch, decode, execute, and writeback.</p>

3. What is RAM and what does it do?

      <p> Alternatively referred to as Random Access Memory (RAM), is a computer storage location that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random location within DRAM on a memory module. Because information is accessed randomly instead of sequentially like a hard drive, the computer is able to access the data much faster than it would if it was only reading the hard drive. However, unlike ROM and the hard drive, RAM requires power in order to keep the data accessible. If power is lost, all data contained in memory will be lost.</p>

4. What is a hard drive and what does it do?

      <p> Alternatively referred to as a hard disk drive and abbreviated as HD or HDD, the hard drive is the computer's main storage device that permanently stores all data on the computer.

5. How do the different components communicate with one another?

              <div>
      <p> The motherboard controls all of the other computer parts so that the computer works. It's where you plug your CPU, memory, and PCI/AGI/PCI express cards into, it is what everything runs through. The motherboard is basically the messanger to all of the parts of the computer.</p>

6. What are the keyboard, mouse, and monitor and what do they do?

        <div>
      <p> The keyboard and mouse help you control your computer. Without a keyboard, you wouldn't be able to type anything. Without a mouse or a touchpad, you wouldn't be able to select certain things. The moniter is one of the most important components of any computer. You wouldn't be able to see anything that you would type or select, rendering the computer almost useless.</p>
