<h3>
<p> Thank you for visiting my first website. This website was requirement to pass my Computer and Information Technology elective this year (2014). The main purpose of my elective is to learn the language of HTML and CSS, as well as learning about components. If you don't know me, I am enrolled in Everest Public High School. My class is located in room 206, on the second floor of my school, and my school is located in Redwood City. I am currently a ninth grader this year (2014), and will hopefully go to college after I graduate. I am currenty learning the HTML and CSS languages this week (which also happens to be my first time learning or even having an idea of what they are), and I hope to learn Javascript as well. Hopefully, I will accomplish many things, including learning how to make improved websites and learning more about computer hardware and computer software.</p>

<p> The majority of the content on my website is about the description and jobs of different parts of computer hardware. It also has a page devoted the the HTML language. </p>
<p>P.S. There is an "easter egg," or hidden link that is accessible somewhere on this website. Try to find it!
