<h3>
<p> My name is Joshua Hickson Dittert. I am in 9th grade at Everest Public High School in Redwood City, California. I was born in Manhattan, New York, but moved to California as a baby, and lived here ever since. I have been to Florida, Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, and England for vacations. I am trying (and failing) at earning pet rats, and I have a strange dysfunctional sister. Two of my favorite hobbies are biking and playing video games. I got into biking when my mom and dad bought me a bike for my birthday when I was three, and I started playing video games when my dad bought my stepmom an Xbox 360 for Christmas. The video games that I like to play are Halo and Team Fortress Two. I also like to play Minecraft. I usually play video games about once a week, and every weekend at my dad's. My favorite parts of playing video games are the stories that are in the games. The authors of them are just really creative when it comes to backstories, easter eggs, and the game itself.</p>
