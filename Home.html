    A lot of people have no idea what HTML is. They don't know that it is basically the backbone of internet web pages. On this page, I am going to explain the basics of the HTML language.</p>

    1. What is HTML and why is it important?</font></p>
  <p> HTML (Hyper-text Mark-up Language) is the backbone of web pages. It is used in conjunction with CSS to make the page you see. It is used to formtat the text, layout, images, links, everthing you see on the page. The combination of these three elements has come to be known as XHTML. Without HTML there would be no websites or pages.</p>
    <p>
      <font color="green">
        2. How is it used?</font></p>
  <p>A website author inserts HTML codes into a plain text file to format the content. The author inserts HTML tags, or commands, before and after words to indicate their format and location on the page. HTML tags are also used to add tables, lists, images, music, and other elements to a webpage.</p>
    <p>
      <font color="green">
        3. Where did it come from?</font></p>
  <p>Tim Burners-Lee defined the URL, HTTP, and HTML specifications regarding the internet at CERN.</p>
    <p>
     <font color="green">
       4. How is it written?</font></p> 
  <p>HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like < html >, only without the spaces between the brackets and the tags). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like < h1 > and < /h1 >, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example < img >. Tags help you format your website, by starting a new paragraph, making a title in a different font, and even adding links. Please keep in mind that if you would write any tags, you would need to make sure that you are NOT adding any spaces between the brackets and the tags. The reason they are like this is that if I didn't have any spaces, the tags would do their actual job. A list of tags will be below.</p>
    <p>
      <font color="green">
        5. What is CSS and why is it important?</font></p> 
  <p>CSS is an extremely powerful style sheet language which is used to control the look and feel of the content written in HTML. So what does this mean? It means that if we have a website element, let's say a "title", and we want to make the text size "20px", the color "black", and the padding around it "10px", we would use CSS to control the look of our element.</p>
 <p><font color="green">
      6. How do tags work?</font></p>
  <p>As I said before, everything you do in a web page is using tags. The basic format of a tag is this:</p>
<p>
  < TAG > (something) < /TAG ></p>
    <p><font color="green">
      7. What is a tag?</font></p>
  <p>HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets. They are explained in question number four.</p>
    <p>
      <font color="green">
        8. How do you write one?</font></p>
  <p>You can write a tag by pressing the open angle bracket key (press and hold shift and then press the , button), then your keyword (such as p for a new paragraph), then the close angle bracket (shift plus . button). Some keywords will be listed below. If you type in a gibberish keyword in between the brackets (such as 12 15 15 13 9 14 1 18 20 25  18 5 22 5 1 12 5 4), nothing will happen and the keyword will not show up on your webpage.</p>
    <p>
      <font color="green">
        9. What are attributes and how do they work?</font></p>
  <p>HTML elements have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes come in name and value pairs like: name="value"</p>
  <p>
    <font color="green">
      10. How do you change attributes?</font></p>
  <p>"< !DOCTYPE html >
< html >
<p>
< head ><p>
< style ><p>
  body { background-color:lightgrey }<p>
  h1   { color:blue }<p>
  p    { color:green }<p>
< /style ><p>
< /head ><p>

< body ><p>
< h1 >This is a heading< /h1 ><p>
< p >This is a paragraph.< /p ><p>
< /body ><p>

< /html >"<p>This would change a simple title and text from:<p>
    /////////////////////////////////////<p>
    This is a heading <p>
    This is a paragraph<p>
    /////////////////////////////////////
    <p>
    <p> To:</p>
    <p>
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
      <h1><p><font color="blue">This is a heading</font></p></h1>
    <p> <font color="green">This is a paragraph</font></p>
    <h3>
      <p>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
      <p>
    <font color="green">
      11. What are some examples?</font></p>
    <p>text() - Sets or returns the text content of selected elements
      <p>
html() - Sets or returns the content of selected elements (including HTML markup)<p>
val() - Sets or returns the value of form fields
  <p>
    <font color="green">
      12. Descriptions of some tags:</font></p>
  <p>< p > This is to start a new paragraph.<p>
    < body > This is to start a new body.<p>
    < font color="green" > This changes the text after the tag green until you write < /font > to make the text back to default.<p>
    < img src="putfilenamehere.jpg" alt "mountain view" > This inputs an image to your webpage.<p>
